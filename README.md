# TGV Denoising in Rust

This is a Rust implementation of the TGV denoising algorithm.

Meant as a learning exercise to understand scientific computing in Rust.

Basic benchmark (M1 Mac Mini Late 2020):
Rust: 4.34 seconds
Python: 4.80 seconds

Roadmap:
- [x] Basic working version
- [x] Add basic benchmarks vs Python implementation
- [ ] Package as CLI tool
